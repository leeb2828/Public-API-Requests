Fetch random employees using the Random User API (https://randomuser.me/api), and display them in a gallery. 

- You can search employees via the search box in the top-right corner of the page. Employees will hide or reappear depending on your search results.

- If you click directly on any of the employees in the gallery, a single modal window with more information about the employee, will appear. You can use the "next" and "prev" buttons to toggle back and forth between employees when the modal window is open.
